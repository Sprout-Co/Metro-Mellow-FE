    title: "Why Your Clothes Smell Musty (And How to Fix It)",
    excerpt:
      "Lagos humidity is ruining your laundry. Here's what we learned from 500+ laundry pickups and how to keep clothes fresh in tropical climate.",
    content: `
If your clothes smell musty within hours of washing, you're not alone. After handling 500+ laundry pickups across Lagos, we've identified the real culprit: humidity management, not just washing technique.

## The Lagos Laundry Challenge

**The Problem**: 80%+ humidity means clothes never fully dry
**The Result**: Mildew growth, musty smell, fabric damage
**The Cost**: Rewashing, replacing clothes, embarrassment

## What We've Learned from 500+ Lagos Laundry Pickups

**Mistake #1: Indoor Drying in Lagos Apartments**
Most Lagos apartments lack proper ventilation. Hanging clothes indoors traps moisture and creates perfect conditions for mildew.

*Our solution*: We use industrial dehumidifiers and strategic airflow in our climate-controlled facility.

**Mistake #2: Overloading Washing Machines**  
Packed washing machines don't rinse properly in humid conditions, leaving detergent residue that attracts bacteria.

*Our solution*: Smaller loads, extra rinse cycles, faster turnaround.

**Mistake #3: Wrong Detergent for Tropical Climate**
Many detergents aren't formulated for Nigeria's high humidity levels.

*Our solution*: Anti-fungal additives and proper concentration ratios for tropical conditions.

## The Metro Mellow Laundry Method for Lagos

1. **Pre-treatment**: Check for humidity damage and stains
2. **Controlled washing**: Optimal load sizes, extra rinses  
3. **Climate-controlled drying**: Professional facility with dehumidifiers
4. **Quality check**: Every item inspected before return

## Quick Fixes for Home Laundry in Lagos

- **Use a fan**: Point directly at drying clothes
- **Vinegar rinse**: Add 1/2 cup white vinegar to final rinse cycle
- **Dry immediately**: Don't let wet clothes sit in machine
- **Iron while damp**: Heat kills remaining moisture and bacteria
- **Dehumidifier**: If possible, use in drying area

## When to Use Professional Laundry Services in Lagos

If you're rewashing clothes or they smell within 24 hours, home methods aren't enough for Lagos climate. Our climate-controlled process ensures fresh clothes every time.

*"I used to rewash everything twice. Now my clothes come back actually fresh and stay that way for weeks." - Michael O., Lekki*

## Laundry Service Areas in Lagos

We provide professional laundry and dry cleaning services across:
- Lekki Phase 1 & 2
- Victoria Island
- Ikoyi
- Surulere
- Ikeja
- Gbagada

## Frequently Asked Questions About Lagos Laundry Care

**Why do clothes smell musty in Lagos weather?**
High humidity (80%+) prevents complete drying, allowing mildew and bacteria to grow on fabric.

**How can I prevent musty smell in clothes?**
Ensure complete drying with fans or dehumidifiers, use vinegar rinse, and don't let wet clothes sit.

**What's the best laundry schedule for Lagos climate?**
Wash smaller loads more frequently and dry immediately to prevent humidity damage.
